Hello Mr. Landlord, My name is Tonia Glover and I'm interested in your rental at 55 Quail Dr. My roommate and I are searching for a peaceful place to live near campus. We are quiet and studious, majoring in physics and psychology, and capable of paying rent through jobs and financial support from parents. Our application packet is ready for review; I would love to set up an appointment to see the property. My phone number is 831-555-5555.
